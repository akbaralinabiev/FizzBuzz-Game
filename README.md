# FizzBuzz-Game


The code defines a function called fizzbuzz that takes in a single argument, n,
which represents the upper bound of the range of numbers for which the FizzBuzz sequence will be printed.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to n+1, and it uses if-elif statements to
check whether the current number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. If the number is divisible by 3,
it prints "Fizz"; if it is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"; and if it is divisible by both, it prints "FizzBuzz".
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.

Getting Started
To get started with FizzBuzz, clone the repository and run the game.py script. The script will prompt you to enter a number,
and it will then print out the FizzBuzz sequence for the numbers from 1 to the number you entered.
